# 📈 Linear Regression from Scratch in Python

This project demonstrates how to implement **Linear Regression** from scratch in Python **without using libraries like NumPy or scikit-learn**. It includes:
- Reading CSV data using `pandas`
- Implementing cost function and gradient descent manually
- Visualizing the regression line using `matplotlib`
- Predicting salary for a given experience

---

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset used is `Salary_Data.csv` from Kaggle/GitHub, containing:
- `YearsExperience`: Number of years of experience
- `Salary`: Corresponding salary in USD

Make sure the CSV file is placed in the same directory as the script.
